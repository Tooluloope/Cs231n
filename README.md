# CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition

For the next few weeks,  I  would  be following  the  Stanford  CS  class
[CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.github.io/). You
can find my solutions to the assignment in this repo.

I would also be writing some Blog posts on medium to explain  my code

-  You can find them
  [here](https://medium.com/@adetulatolu/machine-learning-with-k-nearest-neighbor-k-nn-13ec0ef92551).

A big thank you to all the teams from the CS231n Stanford class  who did a
fantastic work in vulgarizing the knowledge behind neural networks and also [AISaturdays](https://github.com/AISaturdaysLagos) for their Lessons.
